# Articulate
Articulate is a prototyping framework for Framer X which makes it easy to build interactive UI prototypes with complex interaction patterns & custom transitions. It is developed & maintained by the EAX Team.

Articulate aims to expose features such as:
- A Router that can handle custom & advanced transitions between screens
- A Focus System that enables navigation with a Gamepad & Keyboard
- Focusables that are navigatable entities within the Focus System
- Standalone Gamepad-API for non-navigation-related scenarios
- Customizable Grid

Features available at the moment:
- Router
- Gamepad-API

### Documentation

#### Router
The Router uses a “stack” pattern to handle navigation. The component has an array of “routes” (the frames you connect to the component). It also has a “stack” of visited routes.

When navigating to a route, previously viewed routes are added to this navigation stack. So whenever you want to navigate back to a previous screen, the router automatically knows what to navigate back to.

| Prop              | Type                                | Default    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| routes            | ComponentInstance[]                 | []         |
| background        | Color                               | #000       |
| perspective       | Number                              | 0     |
| onMount           | (router: Router) => any             | () => null |
| onTransitionStart | (routerProps: IRouterProps) => any  | () => null |
| onTransitionEnd   | (routerProps: IRouterProps) => any  | () => null |


##### Basic Example

1. Drag & Drop the Router component out to your artboard
2. Drag the handle (located on the Router's right border) to at least 2 frames on your artboard that you want to have navigatable.
3. Select the Router and create a new Code Override file.
4. Simply copy & paste the following code in to that file.

```javascript
import {Override} from 'framer';
import {Transitions} from '@framer/ea.articulate/code/Transitions';

let router;

export const isNavigation: Override = props => {
    return {
        onMount(r: any) {
            router = r;
        },
        onTransitionStart(routerProps: any) {

        },
        onTransitionEnd(routerProps: any) {

        }
    }
}

export const navigateToSecondView: Override = props => {
    return {
        onTap() {
            router.transition(1, Transitions.dissolve);
        }
    }
}

export const isBackButton: Override = props => {
    return {
        onTap() {
            router.transitionPrevious();
        }
    }
}
```
5. You may now assign the "isNavigation" override to the Router component.
6. Make sure to add the "navigateToSecondView"-override to a Frame which should navigate onTap.
7. Add "isBackButton"-override to a Frame which should act as a back-button.
8. Select the Router component and click on the Preview-button (the Play-icon in the upper-right corner).
9. You should now be able to navigate between these two views.
